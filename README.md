# 🏠 Home Loan Default Prediction

# Overview

This project leverages machine learning to predict the probability of a borrower defaulting on a home loan. 
Designed to assist financial institutions, the model provides actionable insights to mitigate risk and enhance decision-making in loan approval processes.

The model analyzes customer profiles and financial data to identify key indicators of default. 
It helps lenders balance profitability with risk management by accurately assessing borrower reliability.

# ✨ Features

Risk Assessment: Accurately predicts the likelihood of default for individual borrowers.
Actionable Insights: Identifies key factors contributing to loan default risk.
Scalable Workflow: The model can be extended to include additional features or datasets.

# Dataset

The dataset contains borrower information, including:

Demographics: Age, employment type, income, etc.
Loan Details: Loan amount, interest rate, tenure, etc.
Credit History: Payment history, credit score, and past loan performance.

# Preprocessing Steps:
Handle missing values and outliers.
Normalize and scale numerical features.
Encode categorical variables using label encoding or one-hot encoding.
Split the dataset into training and testing subsets.

# 📊 Results

Training Accuracy: ~94%
Test Accuracy: ~92%

# Key Insights:
Customers with lower incomes and poor credit scores are at higher risk of default.
Loan tenure and repayment history significantly influence default probability.

# 🛠️ Tools and Technologies
